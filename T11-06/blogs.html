    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a <mark>distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes</mark>.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain <small>(compare linked list data structure)</small>, with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are <em>irreversible</em> in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all <del>deleted-text</del> subsequent blocks.
    <br>
        Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although <ins>blockchain</ins> records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]</p>
